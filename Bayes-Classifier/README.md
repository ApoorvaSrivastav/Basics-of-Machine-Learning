Implementation of Bayes Classifier in Python. 
It is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
It is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
Some popular examples of Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.
